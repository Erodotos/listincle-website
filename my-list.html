      Bitcoin (₿) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>, a form of electronic
      cash. It is a decentralized digital currency without a
      central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the <a

      without the need for intermediaries.
      <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
      Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger
      called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a>. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown
      person or group of people using the name Satoshi
      Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process
      known as <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a>. They can be exchanged for other currencies,
      products, and services. Research produced by
      the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a
      cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.
